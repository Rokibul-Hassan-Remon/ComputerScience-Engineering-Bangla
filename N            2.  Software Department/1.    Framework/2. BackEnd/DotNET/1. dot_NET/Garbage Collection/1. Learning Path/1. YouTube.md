### 📋 Garbage Collection(GC):  Language vs Runtime Comparison

|Language / Framework|Garbage Collection Present?|Who Manages GC?|GC Part of Language?|Notes|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|**Java**|✅ Yes|**JVM (Java Virtual Machine)**|❌ No|GC is handled by JVM, not defined in Java language spec.|
|**C# / .NET**|✅ Yes|**CLR (.NET Common Language Runtime)**|❌ No|C# uses CLR's GC – not part of the C# language itself.|
|**Python**|✅ Yes|**Python Interpreter (e.g., CPython)**|❌ No|GC (ref-counting + cyclic GC) is part of the interpreter, not Python syntax.|
|**C++**|❌ No (Manual)|N/A (compiled to native code)|✅ Yes (manual delete)|No automatic GC. Developer must manage memory using `new` and `delete`.|
|**Go**|✅ Yes|**Go Runtime**|✅ Yes|Go was designed with built-in GC as part of language + runtime.|
|**Rust**|❌ No (Uses Ownership model)|N/A|✅ Yes (via rules)|No GC, uses ownership and borrowing to ensure memory safety at compile time.|
