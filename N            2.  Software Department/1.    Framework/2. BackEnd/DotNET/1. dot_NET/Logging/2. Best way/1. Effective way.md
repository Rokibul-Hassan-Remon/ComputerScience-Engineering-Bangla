## 📘 Effective Logging Best Practices

**🔑 Log Everything That _Matters_, Not Everything You Can**

---

### 🔦 Log Levels: Categorize by Severity

Use different log levels to organize messages based on importance:

- **Debug**  
    Detailed internal state messages used during development.  
    _E.g., variable values, method entry/exit._
    
- **Information**  
    Describes normal app operations.  
    _E.g., user logins, request completion._
    
- **Warning**  
    Indicates potential problems that are non-critical.  
    _E.g., nearing memory limits, deprecated API usage._
    
- **Error**  
    Significant issues that need attention.  
    _E.g., failed service calls, unhandled exceptions._
    
- **Critical**  
    System-level failures requiring urgent response.  
    _E.g., application crash, data loss._

### 🔍 Add Contextual Information

> Always include relevant context:

- `User ID`
    
- `Request ID`
    
- `Timestamp`
    
- `Operation details`
    

✅ This helps in pinpointing the source of an issue quickly.  
❌ Avoid vague or generic log messages like `"Something went wrong"`.

---

### 🚫 Avoid Over-Logging

- Too much logging = **noise**.  
    Don’t log every step at the Information level.
    
- Avoid logging **sensitive data** (e.g., passwords, emails, tokens).
    
- Over-logging can slow down performance and introduce **security risks**.
    

---

### 🧱 Use Structured Logging

- Use structured logging libraries like **Serilog**, **NLog**, or **Log4Net**.
    
- Format logs as JSON for better indexing and analysis.
    
- Great for integration with:
    
    - **ELK Stack**
        
    - **AWS CloudWatch**
        
    - **Azure Monitor**

### ❌ Bad Logging Example
```cs
_logger.LogInformation("Processing request");
_logger.LogInformation("User email: john@example.com");
_logger.LogInformation("Done");

```

Problems:

- Logs too much, but says too little.
    
- Includes **sensitive information**.
    
- Lacks request context or identifiers.
    

---

### ✅ Good Logging Example
```cs
_logger.LogInformation("Processing order {OrderId} for user {UserId} at {Timestamp}", order.Id, user.Id, DateTime.UtcNow);

```
Benefits:

- Precise and helpful
    
- Contains **context**
    
- Avoids logging private data

### 💡 Final Tips

- 🔄 **Log consistently** across the app
    
- 🛡️ **Mask or omit sensitive info**
    
- 📈 **Review logs regularly** for patterns or anomalies
    
- 🧹 **Clean up noisy or redundant logs**
