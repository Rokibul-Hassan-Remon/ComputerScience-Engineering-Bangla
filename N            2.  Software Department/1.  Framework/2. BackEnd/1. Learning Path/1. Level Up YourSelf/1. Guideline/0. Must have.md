90% of backend engineering essentials are in these 10 topics...  
If you want to become a better backend engineer, focus your time and effort in learning on these areas:  
  
1. Data Structures and Algorithms  
- Master key concepts like hash maps, trees, graphs, and linked lists.  
- Focus on sorting algorithms (like quicksort and mergesort) and search algorithms (binary search, DFS, BFS).  
- Understand time complexity (Big-O) to evaluate the efficiency of your code.  
  
2. SQL and Normalization  
- Learn to write efficient SQL queries and understand joins, indexes, and views.  
- Focus on normalization to eliminate redundancy and optimize database performance.  
  
3. SOLID Principles  
- These five principles help you build maintainable and scalable code.  
- Key examples include Single Responsibility (one class for one purpose) and Open-Closed Principle (code that can adapt without modification).  
  
4. Authentication and Authorization  
- Understand OAuth2, JWT, session management, and role-based access control (RBAC).  
- Know how to implement secure login systems and protect APIs.  
  
5. API Development  
- Focus on RESTful and GraphQL APIs.  
- Understand how to properly structure endpoints, handle HTTP methods, and ensure error handling.  
  
6. Design Patterns  
- Get familiar with patterns like Singleton, Factory, Observer, and Repository.  
- These patterns help in writing reusable and modular code.  
  
7. Testing and Debugging  
- Learn how to write unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests.  
- Master debugging tools to quickly identify and fix bugs in production.  
  
8. Server, Network, and Hosting Environments  
- Understand DNS, CDNs, HTTPS, firewalls, and how servers operate.  
- Get hands-on experience with cloud platforms like AWS, Azure, or GCP.  
  
9. Load Balancing and Scalability  
- Learn how horizontal and vertical scaling works.  
- Understand load balancing algorithms to evenly distribute traffic (e.g., round-robin).  
  
10. Caching and Optimization  
- Use Redis, Memcached, or in-memory caching to reduce load.  
- Optimize database queries, reduce API calls, and improve response times.
