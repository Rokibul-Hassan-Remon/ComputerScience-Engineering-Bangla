# 💡 C#/.NET Performance Tip: Prefer `char` Over `string` for Single Character Operations

---

## 🚫 Don’t do this:

```cs
str.IndexOf("s"); 
str.StartsWith("a"); 
str.EndsWith("z");
```

These use **string overloads**, which are **less efficient** when you’re only dealing with a single character.

---

## ✅ Do this instead:

```cs
str.IndexOf('s'); 
str.StartsWith('a');
str.EndsWith('z');
```

These use **char overloads**, which are **faster** because:

- Comparing a single character is **lighter and quicker** than comparing strings.
    
- String comparison may involve extra allocations and length checks.
    

---

## 🔍 Example:

```cs
string text = "Performance"; 
bool result1 = text.StartsWith("P");  
// Slower (string overload) 
bool result2 = text.StartsWith('P'); 
// Faster (char overload)
```

---

## 🚀 Why It Matters:

- String methods like `IndexOf`, `StartsWith`, `EndsWith` offer both **string** and **char** overloads.
    
- When working with **a single character**, always **use single quotes** (`'c'`) and **char overloads**.
    

---

## 📌 Bonus:

- `EndsWith` checks if a string ends with a given **string**, but it also has an overload for **char** (under certain frameworks like .NET Core).
    
- Use the char version whenever applicable.

### 🧠 Think Ahead:

Even small optimizations like this can matter in **high-performance** scenarios such as loops, parsing, or large text processing.
