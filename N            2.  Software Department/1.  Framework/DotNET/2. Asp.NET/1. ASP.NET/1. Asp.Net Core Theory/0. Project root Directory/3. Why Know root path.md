If you want to customise any file or avoid following the default conventions set by the framework, you must understand the concept of the **root path**.

Whenever you try to do something exceptional or outside the standard flow, having a clear understanding of the **core concepts** — including the **root path** — becomes essential.

Suppose you don't want to use the default **Views** folder for your Razor pages and instead want to create a custom folder. In that case, you need to work with the **root directory** to properly set the path and load your views from the new location.

```cs
return new ViewResult
{
    ViewName = "~/CustomViews/MyPage.cshtml"
};

```
