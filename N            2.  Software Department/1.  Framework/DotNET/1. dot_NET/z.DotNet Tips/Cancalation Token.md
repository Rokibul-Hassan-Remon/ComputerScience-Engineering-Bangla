Cancellation Tokens are IMPORTANT  
  
🔎What Are Cancellation Tokens?  
💡Cancellation tokens are a mechanism in .NET that allow you to signal that an operation should be canceled. They are particularly useful in asynchronous programming, where operations can take a long time to complete, and you want the ability to terminate them early if they are no longer needed.  
  
🔦Why Are Cancellation Tokens Important?  
🔧Efficient Resource Utilization:  
Long-running operations consume system resources (CPU, memory, etc.). If these operations are no longer needed (for example, if a user navigates away from a page), you can use cancellation tokens to stop these operations immediately, freeing up resources for other tasks.  
  
🔧Better User Experience:  
In web applications, users expect responsive interactions. If a user cancels a request (such as a file upload or an API call), the application should respect this action and stop processing. This helps avoid scenarios where users wait unnecessarily for operations that have been canceled.  
  
🔧Prevents Performance Bottlenecks:  
If background tasks continue to run when they are no longer needed, they can accumulate and degrade overall performance. By handling cancellation properly, you can avoid overloading the system with unnecessary tasks, ensuring better performance and responsiveness.  
  
🔧Graceful Shutdown Handling:  
When an application is shutting down, it’s important to stop background tasks gracefully rather than abruptly terminating them. Cancellation tokens provide a structured way to manage this, allowing tasks to clean up resources and complete any necessary finalization.  
  
📛Bad Example:  
✖️What’s happening: This endpoint simulates a long-running task that takes 5 seconds to complete. If a user makes a request to this endpoint and then cancels the request (for instance, by navigating away from the page), the server will still wait for the full 5 seconds before it completes the task and returns a response. This leads to wasted resources since the task is no longer needed.  
  
✅️Good Example:  
✔️What’s happening: In this version, the LongRunningTask method accepts a CancellationToken as a parameter. The Task.Delay method is modified to take this token, which means that if the user cancels the request, the Task.Delay will throw a TaskCanceledException, and the execution will jump to the catch block.  
  
✔️Benefits:  
If the user cancels the request, the delay stops immediately, preventing unnecessary resource usage.  
The catch block can return a meaningful response (HTTP status code 499, which is often used to indicate that the client closed the request).
