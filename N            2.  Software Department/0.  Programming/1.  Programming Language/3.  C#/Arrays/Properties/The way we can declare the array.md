**Implicit array declaration** infers the type automatically without `new`.  When System internally done by itself( type casting ) then it called **implicit** 

**Explicit array declaration** specifies the type with `new` explicitly. When System user (Programmer ) do anything by written then it called **Explicit**

There are 2 valid way to declare array .
```C#
	int[] numbers = { 1, 2, 3 }; 
	int[] array = new int[] { 1, 2, 3 };
```

But , here is a slight diff b/w `Implicit` and `Explicit` **array declaration** 

### Understanding the Differences:

1. **`implicit array declaration and initialization`**

    ```C#
 int[] numbers = { 1, 2, 3 };
	```

    - The compiler automatically infers the `type` and `size` of the array based on the provided values.
    - You do not explicitly use the `new` keyword with the type when declaring the array.
    - This syntax is more concise and is commonly used when the type is obvious from the context.

1. **`explicit array declaration and initialization`**

	```c#
	int[] array = new int[] { 1, 2, 3 };
	```
    
    - You explicitly use the `new` keyword and provide the type of the array (`int[]`), followed by the array initializer.
    - This form is more explicit and can be useful when you want to clearly show the allocation of the array.
    - You are directly initializing an `int[]` array with the provided values.

### Key Points:

- Both ways create an integer array of size 3 with elements `{1, 2, 3}`.
- The difference is mostly in style and readability. The first syntax is shorter and more common for simple use cases, while the second syntax is more explicit and can be useful when clarity is needed.
