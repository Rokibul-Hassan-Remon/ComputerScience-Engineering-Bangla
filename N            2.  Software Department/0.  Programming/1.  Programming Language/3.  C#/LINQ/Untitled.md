### **What is LINQ?**

LINQ stands for Language Integrated Query. LINQ allows developers to write queries to retrieve, manipulate, and transform data from different data sources, such as databases, collections, XML, and In-Memory objects. It was introduced with .NET Framework 3.5 & Visual Studio 2008.

### **LINQ Supported Data Sources:**

LINQ can be used with several data sources, and there are different flavors of LINQ based on what you are querying:

- **LINQ to Objects:** Refers to using LINQ queries with any IEnumerable or IEnumerable<T> collection directly in memory.
- **LINQ to SQL:** Allows querying of SQL Server databases, translating LINQ queries into SQL queries that are then executed against the database.
- **LINQ to XML (formerly known as XLINQ):** Provides an in-memory XML programming interface that leverages LINQ to offer a simpler and more declarative way to read, manipulate, and write XML data.
- **LINQ to Entities:** A part of the [ADO.NET](http://ADO.NET) Entity Framework, LINQ to Entities allows querying data sources defined by the Entity Data Model (EDM) through LINQ.
- **LINQ to DataSet:** Designed to work with [ADO.NET](http://ADO.NET) DataSets, allowing for queries on data cached in DataSet objects.

### **What are LINQ Providers?**

The beauty of LINQ is its ability to provide a consistent querying experience across different types of data sources, but it achieves this through using various LINQ providers. Each provider is designed to work with a particular type of data source or a particular way of accessing data.

Here are some key points about LINQ providers:

- **Translation of LINQ Queries:** LINQ providers translate LINQ queries into the native query language of the data source. For example, a LINQ provider for SQL Server translates LINQ queries into T-SQL queries.
- **Different Providers for Different Data Sources:** Different LINQ providers exist for different data sources. Some common ones include:
- **LINQ to Objects:** Used for querying in-memory collections like arrays or lists.
- **LINQ to SQL (DLinq):** Used for querying SQL Server databases.
- **LINQ to Entities (Entity Framework):** Used for querying databases via the Entity Framework, which supports multiple database types.
- **LINQ to XML (XLinq):** Used for querying XML documents.

### **Different Ways to Write LINQ Queries in C#:**

**Query Syntax:** It is similar to SQL and is often more readable for those familiar with SQL.

```csharp
var query = from c in customers
            where c.city == "London"
            select c.name;
```

**Method Syntax (Fluent Syntax):** It uses extension methods and lambda expressions. It can be more concise and is preferred when writing complex queries because it can be easier to read and compose.

```csharp
var query = customers.Where(c => c.city=="London").Select(c =>c.name);
```

### **When to Use LINQ?**

Knowing when to use LINQ is important for writing clean, efficient, and maintainable code. Here are some scenarios where LINQ is particularly useful:

- **Querying Collections:** LINQ is ideal for querying collections like arrays, lists, or any other types that implement IEnumerable. It simplifies the process of filtering, sorting, and grouping data.
- **Database Operations:** With LINQ to SQL or Entity Framework, you can perform database operations. LINQ queries are automatically translated into SQL queries, making it easier to interact with databases without writing raw SQL.
- **Readability and Maintainability:** LINQ queries often result in more readable and maintainable code compared to traditional loops and conditional statements. The syntax is declarative, specifying what you want to do rather than how to do it.
- **Working with XML:** LINQ to XML provides a simple and efficient way to handle XML documents. It allows you to query, modify, and navigate XML data in a more readable and concise way.
- **Joining Data Sources:** If you need to join data from different sources (like different collections, databases, or XML files), LINQ can be a powerful tool. It simplifies the syntax for joining and correlating data from multiple sources.
- **Aggregations and Calculations:** When you need to perform calculations or aggregations (like sum, average, min, max) on a collection of items, LINQ offers straightforward methods to accomplish these tasks.
- **Converting Data Types:** LINQ provides easy-to-use methods for converting one type of data into another, such as converting an array to a list or vice versa.

### **What are the Disadvantages of using LINQ?**

The disadvantages of using LINQ are as follows:

1. Using LINQ, it isn’t easy to write complex queries like SQL.
2. LINQ doesn’t take full advantage of SQL features like a cached execution plan for the stored procedure.
3. We will get the worst performance if we don’t write the queries properly.
4. If we make some changes to our queries, we need to recompile the application and redeploy the DLL to the server.

### **What is a Query?**

A query is nothing but a set of instructions applied to a data source (i.e., In-Memory Objects, SQL Server, XML Document, etc.) to perform certain operations (i.e., CRUD operations) and then tells the shape of the output from that query.

### **What are the Different Ways to Write a LINQ Query?**

1. Query Syntax
2. Method Syntax
3. Mixed Syntax (Query + Method)

### **LINQ Query Syntax:**

Query Syntax is more similar to SQL, providing a readable and declarative way of writing queries. Under the hood, it gets translated into Method Syntax at compile time. This is one of the easy ways to write complex LINQ queries in an easy and readable format. If you are familiar with SQL Queries, it will be easy for you to write LINQ queries using this query syntax. The syntax is given below.

### **LINQ Method Syntax:**

Method Syntax (also known as Fluent Syntax or Lambda Syntax) uses extension methods included in the `System.Linq` namespace and can be chained together to perform complex queries. It is similar to calling methods in a traditional object-oriented programming language. Method syntax has become most popular nowadays for writing LINQ queries. In this approach, the LINQ query is written using multiple methods by combining them with a dot (.), i.e., **method chaining**. The Syntax is given below:

![image.png](https://prod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/55d99e60-ff68-4727-8692-d8531fd8713f/8ed71a77-d80c-4ae2-8b7c-1c18e1a17923/image.png)

### **LINQ Mixed Syntax:**

You can also mix both syntaxes, although this is less common. This is the combination of both Query and Method syntax. The syntax is given below.

![image.png](https://prod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/55d99e60-ff68-4727-8692-d8531fd8713f/f35c966c-33c8-4179-8579-b446600de314/image.png)

```csharp
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Linq;
namespace LINQDemo
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            //Step1: Data Source
            List<int> integerList = new List<int>()
            {
                1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10
            };

            //Step2: Query
            //LINQ Query using Query Syntax to fetch all numbers which are > 5
            var QuerySyntax = integerList.Where(obj => obj > 5).ToList(); 

            //Step3: Execution
            foreach (var item in QuerySyntax)
            {
                Console.Write(item + " ");
            }

            Console.ReadKey();
        }
    }
}

//LINQ Query using Mixed Syntax
            var MethodSyntax = (from obj in integerList
                                where obj > 5
                                select obj).Sum();
```


### **IEnumerable and IQueryable in C#**

![image.png](https://prod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/55d99e60-ff68-4727-8692-d8531fd8713f/82d672b6-952a-4120-93d0-75e6ad3a1023/image.png)

In the above example, we use the **var** keyword to create the variable and store the result of the LINQ query. So, let’s check what the type of variable is. To check this, just mouse over the pointer onto the QuerySynntax variable, and you will see that the type is **IEnumerable<int>.**

```csharp
class Program
{
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        List<int> numbers = new List<int>()
        {
            1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9
        };

        IEnumerable<int> methodSyntax = numbers.Where(obj => obj > 5).ToList();

        foreach(var item in methodSyntax)
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Numbers are: " + item);
        }

    }
}
```

### **What is IEnumerable in C#?**

IEnumerable in C# is an interface that defines one method, GetEnumerator, which returns an IEnumerator object. This interface is found in the **System.Collections** namespace. It is a key part of the .NET Framework and is used to iterate over a collection of objects. The following is the definition of the IEnumerator interface.

![image.png](https://prod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/55d99e60-ff68-4727-8692-d8531fd8713f/4cec8ae2-38af-4e4d-bff7-10d60544941d/image.png)

### **GetEnumerator Method:**

This is the only method defined in the IEnumerable interface. It returns an IEnumerator object, which provides the ability to iterate through the collection by exposing a Current property and MoveNext() and Reset() methods.

- **Current**: A property that gets the current element in the collection.
- **MoveNext()**: This advances the enumerator to the next element of the collection.
- **Reset():** Sets the enumerator to its initial position, which is before the first element in the collection.

**IEnumerable is typically used with a foreach loop in C#. The foreach loop automatically uses the GetEnumerator() method and the IEnumerator object to iterate over the elements of the collection.**

### **Key Characteristic of IEnumerator in C#:**

- **Purpose:** It provides a simple iteration over a collection of a specified type. It’s primarily used for in-memory collections like arrays, lists, etc.
- **Execution:** When you use LINQ methods on an IEnumerable, the query is executed in the client’s memory. This means all the data is loaded into memory from the data source (like a database), and the operation is performed.
- **Methods:** The extension methods for IEnumerable are defined in the System.Linq.Enumerable class.
- **Deferred Execution:** It supports deferred execution, but the query logic is executed locally on the client side.
- **Use Case:** Best suited for working with in-memory data where the dataset is not too large.

```csharp
public class Student
{
    public int ID { get; set; }
    public string Gender { get; set; }
    public string Name { get; set; }
}

class Program
{
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        List<Student> studentList = new List<Student>()
       {
           new Student(){ID=1, Gender="Male", Name="Sakhawat"},
           new Student(){ID=2, Gender="Female", Name="Saku2"},
           new Student(){ID=3, Name="Md SaKHAAWAT ullah", Gender="Male"}

       };

        IEnumerable<Student> stdMethod = studentList.Where(s => s.Gender == "Male").ToList();

        foreach(var item in stdMethod)
        {
            Console.WriteLine($"id: {item.ID}, {item.Gender}");
        }

    }
}
//id: 1, Male
//id: 3, Male
```

### **What is IQueryable in C#?**

IQueryable in C# is an interface that is used to query data from a data source. It is part of the `System.Linq` namespace and is a key component in LINQ (Language Integrated Query). Unlike IEnumerable, which is used for iterating over in-memory collections, IQueryable is designed for querying data sources where the query is not executed until the object is enumerated. This is particularly useful for remote data sources, like databases, enabling efficient querying by allowing the query to be executed on the server side. The following is the definition of the IQueryable interface.

![image.png](https://prod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/55d99e60-ff68-4727-8692-d8531fd8713f/0b2b8b4e-22fd-471f-b903-b38cc6f48b11/image.png)

Here are the key aspects of IQueryable:

- **Deferred Execution:** IQueryable defers the execution of the query until the queryable object is actually iterated over. This means the query is not executed when defined but when the results are required.
- **Expression Trees:** IQueryable queries are represented as expression trees. An expression tree is a data structure that represents code in a tree-like format, where each node is an expression, such as a method call or a binary operation. This allows the query to be translated into a format that can be understood by the data source, such as SQL for a database.
- **Query Providers:** IQueryable relies on an implementation of the IQueryProvider interface to execute queries. The provider translates the expression tree into a format that can be executed against the data source.

### **Key Characteristic of IQueryable in C#:**

- **Purpose:** It is intended to query data from out-of-memory sources, like a database or web service. It is a powerful feature for LINQ, SQL, and Entity Framework.
- **Execution:** The query logic is translated into a format suitable for the data source (like SQL for a relational database). The query is executed on the server side, which can improve performance and reduce network traffic.
- **Methods:** The extension methods for IQueryable are defined in the `System.Linq.Queryable` class.
- **Deferred Execution:** Supports deferred execution, and the query is executed in the data source (like a database).
- **Use Case:** This is ideal for remote data sources, like databases, where you want to leverage server-side resources and minimize data transfer.

```csharp
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Linq;

namespace LINQDemo
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            List<Student> studentList = new List<Student>()
            {
                new Student(){ID = 1, Name = "James", Gender = "Male"},
                new Student(){ID = 2, Name = "Sara", Gender = "Female"},
                new Student(){ID = 3, Name = "Steve", Gender = "Male"},
                new Student(){ID = 4, Name = "Pam", Gender = "Female"}
            };
            
            //Linq Query to Fetch all students with Gender Male
            IQueryable<Student> MethodSyntax = studentList.AsQueryable()
                                .Where(std => std.Gender == "Male");
                                              
            //Iterate through the collection
            foreach (var student in MethodSyntax)
            {
                Console.WriteLine( $"ID : {student.ID}  Name : {student.Name}");
            }

            Console.ReadKey();
        }
    }

    public class Student
    {
        public int ID { get; set; }
        public string Name { get; set; }
        public string Gender { get; set; }
    }
}
```

### **Key Differences Between IEnumerable and IQueryable in C#**

- **Execution Context:** IEnumerable executes in the client memory, whereas IQueryable executes on the data source.
- **Suitability:** IEnumerable is suitable for LINQ to Objects and working with in-memory data. IQueryable is suitable for LINQ to SQL or Entity Framework to interact with databases.
- **Performance:** IQueryable can perform better for large data sets as it allows the database to optimize and filter data.

### **Choosing Between IEnumerable and IQueryable in C#:**

- Use IEnumerable when working with in-memory data collections where the data set is not excessively large.
- Use IQueryable when querying data from out-of-memory sources like databases, especially when dealing with large data sets, to take advantage of server-side processing and optimizations.

### **Differences Between IEnumerable and IQueryable in C#**

The IEnumerable and IQueryable in C# are used to hold a collection of data and also to perform data manipulation operations such as filtering, ordering, grouping, etc., based on the business requirements.

                                   .AsQueryable()
                                   .Where(x => x.Gender == "Male");
                listStudents = listStudents.Take(2);
```

### **IEnumerable vs. IQueryable in C#**

IEnumerable and IQueryable are both interfaces in C# that are used for data manipulation and query operations, but they serve different purposes and are used in different contexts. Understanding their differences is important for efficient and effective data operations in C#. Here’s a comparison:

### **Namespace:**

- **IEnumerable:** It is defined in the System.Collections namespace.
- **IQueryable:** It is defined in the System.Linq namespace.

### **Purpose and Data Sources:**

- **IEnumerable:** Primarily used for querying and manipulating in-memory collections, such as arrays, lists, and IEnumerable-compatible collections. Designed for querying data that is already in memory.
- **IQueryable:** Used for querying data from external data sources that may not be in memory, such as databases, web services, or remote data stores. Designed for querying data that resides outside of the application’s memory.

### **Data Source:**

- **IEnumerable:** It can be used with any in-memory data collection, like arrays, lists, etc.
- **IQueryable:** It is typically used for remote data sources like databases, especially with ORM frameworks like Entity Framework.

### **Querying Capability:**

- **IEnumerable:** It supports LINQ-to-Objects, meaning it can execute LINQ queries on in-memory collections.
- **IQueryable:** It supports LINQ-to-Entities, meaning it can translate LINQ queries into database-specific query languages (like SQL for relational databases).

### **Execution Location:**

- **IEnumerable:** Operations are executed in memory. All data is retrieved from the collection, and subsequent operations are performed in memory.
- **IQueryable:** Operations are typically translated into a query language (e.g., SQL for databases) and executed on the data source. This allows for server-side processing and optimization.

### **Lazy Evaluation:**

- **IEnumerable**: Supports lazy evaluation. Operations are only executed when the collection is enumerated (e.g., in a for each loop).
- **IQueryable**: Also supports lazy evaluation. Queries are not executed until you enumerate the results, allowing for efficient resource use.

### **Query Translation:**

- **IEnumerable**: LINQ methods are executed in memory on the entire data set. Filtering, sorting, and other operations are performed locally.
- **IQueryable**: LINQ methods are translated into a query language specific to the data source (e.g., SQL) and executed on the data source. This allows for efficient server-side operations.

### **Suitable Use Cases:**

- **IEnumerable:** Suitable for working with small to moderate-sized in-memory collections where the entire data set can fit in memory. Typically used for in-memory data manipulation and querying.
- **IQueryable:** Suitable for working with large data sets or data sources external to the application, such as databases. It is ideal for offloading query execution to the data source, enabling efficient database querying.

### **Choosing Between Them**

1. Use IEnumerable for in-memory data collections or when dealing with small data sets.
2. Use IQueryable when querying large data sets or remote data sources like databases, especially when you need efficient querying and data retrieval.

### **What are Extension Methods in C#?**

According to MSDN, Extension Methods allow us to add methods to existing types without creating a new derived type, recompiling, or modifying the original type.

### **LINQ Operators in C#**

### **Projection Operators:**

These operators transform the elements of a sequence into a new form.

- **Select:** The LINQ Select Operator can return a scaler value, a custom class, a collection of custom classes, or an anonymous type, which includes properties per our business requirements.
- **SelectMany:** Projects each sequence element to an IEnumerable<T> and flattens the resulting sequences into one sequence.

```csharp
class Program
{
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        List<string> nameList = new List<string>() { "Md. Sakhawat", "Ullah" };
        IEnumerable<char> methodSyntx = nameList.SelectMany(x => x);
        foreach(var c in methodSyntx)
        {
            Console.Write(c + " ");
        }

    }
}
//output:
//M d .   S a k h a w a t U l l a h

```

```csharp

        public int ID { get; set; }
        public string Name { get; set; }
        public string Email { get; set; }
        public List<string> Programming { get; set; }
        public static List<Student> GetStudents()
        {
            return new List<Student>()

### **When should we use the LINQ SelectMany Method in C#?**

Here are some common scenarios when you might want to use SelectMany:

- **Flattening Nested Collections**: For example, if you have a list of departments, and each department has a list of employees, and you want a combined list of all employees across all departments.
- **Cross Product or Cartesian Product:** When you need to perform a cross join or Cartesian product between two sequences where each item from the first sequence is paired with every item of the second sequence. This is often used in scenarios where you want to combine elements from different sources.
- **Querying Multi-Level Hierarchies:**  For example, accessing grandchild elements in a tree-like structure.
- **Concatenating Sequences Inside a Collection:** If you have a collection where each element itself is a sequence, and you want to concatenate these sequences into one single sequence.

### **Filtering Operators:**

Filtering is nothing but the process of getting only those elements from a data source that **satisfies the given condition.**

These are used for filtering data.

> **Where:** Filters a sequence of values based on a predicate. That takes each element in the collection and returns a `boolean` value. If the function returns true for an element, it is included in the result; otherwise, it’s excluded.

```csharp
IEnumerable<int> filteredData = intList.Where(num => num > 5);

//It can be rewritten as shown below
Func<int, bool> predicate = i => i > 5;
IEnumerable<int> filteredData = intList.Where(predicate);
```

```csharp
class Program
{
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        List<int> numList = new List<int> { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 };
        //Using Method Syntax
        var MethodSyntax = numList.Where(num => num > 5);
        foreach (var p in MethodSyntax)
        {
            Console.WriteLine(p);
        }
    }
}
//output:
6
7
8
9
```

**Note: _It’s important to note that the Where method uses deferred execution. This means the filtering is not actually performed when the Where method is called. Instead, the filtering happens when you iterate over the filtered collection, like when using a `foreach` loop or converting it to a list or an array._**

```csharp
class Program
{
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        List<int> intList = new List<int> { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 };
        //Method Syntax
        var methodSyntax = intList.Select((num, index) => new
        {
            Numbers = num,
            Position = index
        }).Where(n => n.Numbers % 2 != 0)
        .Select(data => new
        {
            Number = data.Numbers,
            IndexPosition = data.Position
        });

        foreach(var item in methodSyntax)
        {
            Console.WriteLine($"Number is: {item.Number}, Its Position: {item.IndexPosition}");
        }
    }
}

//output:
Number is: 1, Its Position: 0
Number is: 3, Its Position: 2
Number is: 5, Its Position: 4
Number is: 7, Its Position: 6
Number is: 9, Its Position: 8

```

```csharp
//Method Syntax
 var MethodSyntax = Employee.GetEmployees()
                            .Where(emp => emp.Salary > 500000 && emp.Gender == "Male")
                            .ToList();
```

```csharp
//Condition:
//Name as it is
//Gender as it is
//MonthlySalary = Salary / 12

//Method Syntax
var MethodSyntax = Employee.GetEmployees()
                           .Where(emp => emp.Salary >= 50000 && emp.Technology != null)
                           .Select(emp => new {
                                   EmployeeName = emp.Name,
                                   Gender = emp.Gender,
                                   MonthlySalary = emp.Salary / 12
                             })
                            .ToList()
```

### **When should you use the LINQ Where Method in C#?**

Here are some common situations where Where might be the right choice:

- **Filtering Data:** The most common use of Where is to filter a collection based on some criteria.
- **Combining with Other LINQ Methods:** The Where Method can be used in combination with other LINQ methods, like Select, OrderBy, GroupBy, etc., to perform complex queries on data.
- **Deferred Execution:** LINQ queries, including those using the LINQ Where Method, benefit from deferred execution. This means the actual filtering doesn’t happen until you iterate over the collection. This can be efficient when **working with large data sets** or when conditions change before the collection is iterated.
- **Working with In-Memory Collections and IQueryable Data Sources:** The Where Method is versatile and can be used both with in-memory collections like List<T> and Array, as well as IQueryable data sources like databases via Entity Framework. The syntax remains consistent, which simplifies coding across different data sources.
- **Chain Filtering Conditions:** You can chain multiple Where calls to apply multiple filters. Each call further refines the data set.
- **Performance Considerations:** For large collections, using Where can be more performant than manual looping, especially if chained with other LINQ methods that optimize the query execution.

> **OfType:** Filters the elements of an array based on a specified type.

if we need to fetch either the integer values or only the string values from that collection, then we need to use the **LINQ OfType** Operator.

```csharp
List<object> dataSource = new List<object>()
            {
                "Tom", "Mary", 50, "Prince", "Jack", 10, 20, 30, 40, "James"
            };
            //Using Method Syntax
            var intData = dataSource.OfType<int>().Where(num => num > 30).ToList();
            foreach (int number in intData)
            {
                Console.Write(number + " ");
            }
            Console.WriteLine();
```

# **Partitioning Operators:**

These operators divide a sequence into two parts and return one of them.

- **Take:** This operator selects the **first n elements** from a sequence. If the sequence contains **fewer than n elements**, it returns all the available elements. For example, `var firstThree = numbers.Take(3);` // Takes the first three elements
- **Skip:** Bypasses a specified number of elements in a sequence and then returns the remaining elements.
- **TakeWhile:** It returns elements from the start of a sequence as long as a specified condition is true. Once an element fails the condition, the method stops. For example, `var takenWhile = numbers.TakeWhile(n => n < 4)`; // Takes numbers less than 4.
- **Skip:** This operator bypasses a specified number of elements in a sequence and then returns the remaining elements. For example, `var allButFirstThree = numbers.Skip(3);` // Skips the first three elements.
- **SkipWhile:** It bypasses elements in a sequence as long as a specified condition is true and then returns the remaining elements. For example, `var skippedWhile = numbers.SkipWhile(n => n < 4);` // Skips numbers less than 4

```csharp
class Program
{
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        List<int> numbers = new List<int> { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 };
        // Take the first 5 numbers
        IEnumerable<int> firstFive = numbers.Take(5);
        // Take numbers while they are less than 6
        IEnumerable<int> lessThanSix = numbers.TakeWhile(n => n < 6);
        // Skip the first 5 numbers
        IEnumerable<int> skipFirstFive = numbers.Skip(5);
        // Skip numbers while they are less than 6
        IEnumerable<int> skipLessThanSix = numbers.SkipWhile(n => n < 6);
        // Display the results
        Console.WriteLine("First Five: " + string.Join(", ", firstFive));
        Console.WriteLine("Less Than Six: " + string.Join(", ", lessThanSix));
        Console.WriteLine("Skip First Five: " + string.Join(", ", skipFirstFive));
        Console.WriteLine("Skip Less Than Six: " + string.Join(", ", skipLessThanSix));
    }
}

//output:
First Five: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
Less Than Six: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
Skip First Five: 6, 7, 8, 9, 10
Skip Less Than Six: 6, 7, 8, 9, 10
```

### **When to use LINQ Partitioning Operators in C#?**

LINQ partitioning operators in C#, such as Take, Skip, TakeWhile, SkipWhile, TakeLast, and **SkipLast,** are useful in various scenarios when you need to work with specific subsets of data or extract elements from specific positions within a collection. Here are some common scenarios when you should consider using LINQ partitioning operators:

- **Paging:** When implementing pagination in a user interface, you might use Take to display a specific number of items on each page and Skip to bypass the number of items displayed on all previous pages.
- **Top N or Bottom N Records:** When you want to retrieve the top N records with the highest values or the bottom N records with the lowest values from a sorted dataset, you can use Take and TakeLast.
- **Performance Optimization:** When working with a small subset of a large collection, using Take or Skip can help minimize the workload by only processing the required elements.
- **Conditional Retrieval:** TakeWhile and SkipWhile are useful when you need elements up to the point where a condition is met. For instance, in a list of sorted dates, you might want to take all dates until the end of the current year.
- **Data Sampling:** If you want to sample a fixed number of items from a dataset, perhaps for testing or analysis, Take can be used to extract just those items easily.
- **Streaming Data:** When dealing with streaming data or large datasets where you do not want to or cannot load all the data into memory at once, partitioning operators allow you to work with the data in chunks.
- **Sequential Processing:** In scenarios where data must be processed in a certain sequence until a condition changes (like errors in a log file), TakeWhile and SkipWhile can process only the relevant sections.
- **Resource Management:** When dealing with resources that need to be used sparingly (like API calls that have rate limits), partitioning operators can help manage how much data you are processing at a time.

## **Paging Using LINQ Skip and Take Method in C#**

Paging, in the context of software development and data management, refers to **dividing a large dataset or collection** of information into **smaller**, more manageable segments or **“pages”.**

```csharp
public class Employee
{
    public int ID {get; set;}
    public string Name { get; set; }
    public string Department { get; set; }

    public static List<Employee> GetAllEmployee()
    {
        return new List<Employee>()
        {
             new Employee() {ID = 1, Name = "Pranaya", Department = "IT" },
                new Employee() {ID = 2, Name = "Priyanka", Department = "IT" },
                new Employee() {ID = 3, Name = "Preety", Department = "IT" },
                new Employee() {ID = 4, Name = "Sambit", Department = "IT" },
                new Employee() {ID = 5, Name = "Sudhanshu", Department = "HR" },
                new Employee() {ID = 6, Name = "Santosh", Department = "HR" },
                new Employee() {ID = 7, Name = "Happy", Department = "HR" },
                new Employee() {ID = 8, Name = "Raja", Department = "IT" },
                new Employee() {ID = 9, Name = "Tarun", Department = "IT" },
                new Employee() {ID = 10, Name = "Bablu", Department = "IT" },
                new Employee() {ID = 11, Name = "Hina", Department = "HR" },
                new Employee() {ID = 12, Name = "Anurag", Department = "HR" },
                new Employee() {ID = 13, Name = "Dillip", Department = "HR" },
                new Employee() {ID = 14, Name = "Manoj", Department = "HR" },
                new Employee() {ID = 15, Name = "Lima", Department = "IT" },
                new Employee() {ID = 16, Name = "Sona", Department = "IT" },
        };

    }

}

class Program
{
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        int pageNumber = 0;
        int noOfRecords = 4;

        do
        {
            if (int.TryParse(Console.ReadLine(), out pageNumber))
            {
                if (pageNumber > 0 && pageNumber < 5)
                {

                    var employee = Employee.GetAllEmployee()
                                           .Skip((pageNumber - 1) * noOfRecords)
                                           .Take(noOfRecords);
                    foreach (var item in employee)
                    {
                        Console.WriteLine($"Id: {item.ID} + Name: {item.Name} + Dept: {item.Department}");
                    }
                }
            }
        } while (true);
    }
}

//output:
4 //pageNumber
Id: 13 + Name: Dillip + Dept: HR
Id: 14 + Name: Manoj + Dept: HR
Id: 15 + Name: Lima + Dept: IT
Id: 16 + Name: Sona + Dept: IT
```

# **Ordering Operators:**

These operators arrange the elements of a sequence. Used to sort the elements of a sequence or collection.

- **OrderBy:** Sorts the elements of a sequence in `ascending` order according to a key.

```csharp
 //Using Method Syntax
 var MS = stringList.OrderBy(name => name); 
 
 //Method Syntax
 var MS = Student.GetAllStudents().OrderBy(x => x.Branch).ToList();
```

```csharp
//Now we need to fetch only the CSE branch students, 
//and then we need to sort the data based on the First Name in Ascending order. 
//The most important point you need to remember is to use the Where method before 
//the OrderBy method.

//Method Syntax
 var MS = Student.GetAllStudents()
                  .Where(std => std.Branch.ToUpper() == "CSE")
                   .OrderBy(x => x.FirstName).ToList();
```

```csharp
//Using Method Syntax
var MS = Student.GetAllStudents()
                 .OrderBy(x => x.FirstName)
                 .ThenBy(y => y.LastName)
                 .ToList();
```

- **OrderByDescending:** Sorts the elements of a sequence in descending order according to a key.
    
- **_ThenBy_:** Performs a subsequent ordering of the elements in a sequence in ascending order. The **OrderBy** or **OrderByDescending** method is generally used for **primary** sorting. The **ThenBy** or **ThenByDescending** Methods are used for **secondary** sorting.
    

```csharp
//First, fetch only the CSE branch students
//Sort the Students in ascending order based on First Name
//Sort the students in descending order based on their Last Names
ing Method Syntax
var MS = Student.GetAllStudents()
                .Where(std => std.Branch == "CSE")
                .OrderBy(x => x.FirstName)
                .ThenByDescending(y => y.LastName)
                .ToList();
```

- **ThenByDescending:** Performs a subsequent ordering of the elements in a sequence in descending order.
- **Reverse:** Inverts the order of the elements in a sequence.

### **Grouping Operators:**

These operators group elements of a sequence based on a specified key value.

- **GroupBy:** Groups the elements of a sequence according to a specified key selector function. Allows us to organize elements of a collection into groups based on a specified **key** value.

# **Join Operators:**

These operators are used to combine elements from two or more sequences.

### **Types of LINQ Join:**

- **Inner Join (Join):** The Join method performs an inner join by correlating the elements of two collections based on **matching keys**. It returns a new collection that includes **only elements from both collections** where the keys match. If an element from either collection does not have a match in the other, it is **not included** in the result.
- **Group Join (GroupJoin):** The GroupJoin method is **similar to an inner join**, but instead of returning a flat collection of matched pairs, it groups matching elements from the second collection for each element in the first collection. This operation is **useful for hierarchical data relationships**, such as when you want to associate each item in one collection with a collection of related items in another.
- **Left Outer Join:** While LINQ does not have a built-in method for left outer joins like it does for inner and group joins, you can achieve a left outer join by using the GroupJoin method followed by the **SelectMany** method with a **DefaultIfEmpty** method call. This operation **returns all elements from the first collection** and, for elements of the first collection that have matches in the second collection, includes the matching elements.
- **Cross Join:** In a cross join, every element of the first collection is combined with every element of the second collection, resulting in a **Cartesian product** of the two collections. This type of **join** **doesn’t require a key** for joining and is implemented using the **SelectMany** method.
- **Join:** Joins two sequences based on matching keys.

### **Set Operators:**

### **Examples of Set Operations:**

Let us discuss some examples where we need to use the set operations.

1. If we need to select distinct records from a data source (No Duplicate Records), then we need to use Set Operators.
2. Suppose we need to select all the Employees of a company except a particular department;
3. Another example is that if you have multiple classes and you only want to select all the toppers from all the classes —> need to use Set Operations.
4. Suppose you have different data sources with similar structures, and you want to combine all the data sources into a single data source —> need to use Set Operations.

```csharp
class Program
{
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        int[] list1 = { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 };
        int[] list2 = { 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 };

        var disnt = list1.Distinct();
        Console.WriteLine("Distinct: " + string.Join(", ", disnt));

        var union = list1.Union(list2);
        Console.WriteLine("Union: " + string.Join(", ", union));

        var inst = list1.Intersect(list2);
        Console.WriteLine("Intersect: " + string.Join(", ", inst));

        var except = list1.Except(list2);
        Console.WriteLine("Except: " + string.Join(", ", except));

        var concat = list1.Concat(list2);
        Console.WriteLine("Concate: " + string.Join(", ", concat));
       
    }
}

//output:
Distinct: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
Union: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8
Intersect: 4, 5
Except: 1, 2, 3
Concate: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8
```

- The Union, Intersect, and Except methods all produce sets that **do not include duplicate** elements. If you need to maintain duplicates, you would need to use concatenation (Concat) and maybe additional filtering.

These operators perform mathematical set operations on sequences.

- **Distinct:** Removes duplicate elements from a sequence.

It internally uses a set data structure to keep track of elements. It iterates over the elements of the collection, and for each element, it checks whether the set already contains an element equal to it. `is case-sensitive`.

```csharp
.Select(std => std.Name)
.Distinct().ToList();
```

- **Union:** Produces the set union of two sequences. Union automatically **removes duplicate elements**. This differs from the **Concat method**, which concatenates two sequences without removing duplicates. The Union method internally uses a **Set<T>** to keep track of elements that have already been added. This helps in efficiently determining duplicates. • **Null Values:** If either of the collections is null, Union will throw an ArgumentNullException.

- **Intersect:** Produces the set intersection of two sequences. Finds common elements between two sequences (collections).

- **Except:** Produces the set difference of two sequences. [ baad jabe]

                                .ToList();
            
            foreach (var name in MS)
            {
                Console.WriteLine(name);
            }
            
            Console.ReadKey();
        }
    }
    //output:
    Preety
    Hina
    Santosh
```

### **When to Use LINQ Except Method in C#?**

Here are some common scenarios where you might want to use the Except method:

- **Filtering out Unwanted Elements:** If you have a list of items and want to exclude certain elements contained in another list, Except is an efficient way to accomplish that.
- **Data Comparison:** When comparing data from different sources or time periods, Except can help identify which items have been removed or are no longer present.

> **Concat:** While not strictly a set operation in the mathematical sense, **Concat** in LINQ is used to append one sequence to another. Unlike Union, Concat **does not remove duplicates.**

### **Conversion Operators:**

These are used to convert one type of sequence or collection to another.

- **AsEnumerable:** Casts an IEnumerable to an IEnumerable<T>.
- **ToArray:** Converts a sequence to an array.
- **ToList:** Converts a sequence to a List<T>.
- **ToDictionary:** Converts a sequence to a Dictionary<TKey, TValue> based on a key selector function.

# **Element Operators:**

These operators return a single element from a sequence.

- **First:** Returns the first element of a sequence.
- **FirstOrDefault:** Returns the first element of a sequence or a default value if no element is found.
- **Last:** Returns the last element of a sequence.
- **LastOrDefault:** Returns the last element of a sequence or a default value if no element is found.
- **Single:** Returns the only element of a sequence and throws an exception if there is not exactly one element in the sequence.
- **SingleOrDefault:** Returns the only element of a sequence or a default value if the sequence is empty; this method throws an exception if there is more than one element in the sequence.
- **ElementAt:** Returns the element at a specified index in a sequence.
- **ElementAtOrDefault:** Returns the element at a specified index in a sequence or a default value if the index is out of range.

### **Quantifier Operators:**

These operators return a Boolean value indicating whether all or any of the elements of a sequence satisfy a condition. Examples are All, Any, and Contains.

- **Any:** Determines whether any element of a sequence satisfies a condition. If at least one element meets the condition, it returns `true`; otherwise, it returns `false.`

```csharp
 var numbers = new List<int> { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 };
 bool anyGreaterThanThree = numbers.Any(x => x > 3);
 // true, as at least one element is greater than 3
```

- **All:** Determines whether all elements of a sequence satisfy a condition. Whether **all elements** in a sequence satisfy a specified condition. It returns `true` if every element meets the condition and `false` if at least one element does not.

```csharp
var numbers = new List<int> { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 };
bool allGreaterThanZero = numbers.All(x => x > 0); // true, as all elements are greater than 0
bool allEven = numbers.All(x => x % 2 == 0); // false, as not all elements are even
```

- **Contains:** Determines whether a sequence contains a specified element.

```csharp
var numbers = new List<int> { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 };
bool containsFive = numbers.Contains(5); 
// checks if the sequence contains the number 5
```

### **Deferred Execution vs Immediate Execution in LINQ**

1. **Deferred or Lazy Operators:** These Query Operators are used for Deferred Execution. For example – **Select, SelectMany, Where, Take, Skip**, etc. belong to the Deferred or Lazy Operators Category.
2. **Immediate or Greedy Operators:** These Query Operators are used for Immediate Execution. For example – **Count, Average, Min, Max, First, Last, ToArray, ToList,** etc., belong to the Immediate or Greedy Operators category.

# **LINQ ToList and ToArray Methods**

To convert collections or sequences to a List<T> or an array T[], respectively.

**Use ToList when you need the dynamic features of a list (like adding or removing items), and use ToArray when you need a fixed-size, immutable collection or are interfacing with APIs that require arrays.**

# **Aggregate Operators:**

These operators perform a calculation on a sequence and return a single value. LINQ Aggregate Operators perform mathematical operations.

- **Count:** Counts the elements in a sequence.
- **LongCount:** Counts the elements in a sequence, returning the count as a long.
- **Sum:** Computes the sum of a sequence of numeric values.
- **Min:** Returns the minimum value in a sequence.
- **Max:** Returns the maximum value in a sequence.
- **Average:** Computes the average of a sequence of numeric values.
- **Aggregate:** Applies an accumulator function over a sequence.

```csharp
var numbers = new List<int> { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 };
int product = numbers.Aggregate((accumulator, number) => accumulator * number); 
//Return 120 => 1 * 2 * 3 * 4 * 5

//Detailed Iteration Process
//Here’s how the Aggregate method processes the list step-by-step:

//First Iteration:

accumulator is initialized to the first element of the list: 1.
number is the second element: 2.
Result: 1 * 2 = 2.
The accumulator is now 2.

//Second Iteration:

accumulator is now 2 (result from the previous iteration).
number is the third element: 3.
Result: 2 * 3 = 6.
The accumulator is now 6.

//Third Iteration:

accumulator is now 6.
number is the fourth element: 4.
Result: 6 * 4 = 24.
The accumulator is now 24.

//Fourth Iteration:

accumulator is now 24.
number is the fifth element: 5.
Result: 24 * 5 = 120.
//The accumulator is now 120.
//After all iterations, the final value of the accumulator is 120, 
//which is the product of all the numbers in the list.
```

# **Equality Operators:**

These operators are used to compare sequences for equality. An example is SequenceEqual.

- **SequenceEqual:** Determines whether two sequences are equal by comparing the elements by using the default equality comparer for their type.

# **Generation Operators:**

These operators are used to create a new sequence of values. Examples include Range, Repeat, and Empty.

- **Empty:** Returns an empty IEnumerable<T> with the specified type argument.
- **Repeat:** Generates a sequence that contains one repeated value.
- **Range:** Generates a sequence of integral numbers within a specified range.

```csharp
//Repeating the string value Welcome to DOT NET Tutorials for 10 Times
//Using the Repeat Method
Enumerable<string> repeatStrings = Enumerable.Repeat("Welcome to DOT NET Tutorials", 10);

//Accessing the collection or sequence using a foreach loop
 foreach (string str in repeatStrings)
 {
   Console.WriteLine(str);
 }
```

```csharp
// Creating a list of integer
ist<int> intSequence = new List<int> { 10, 20, 30, 40 };
Console.WriteLine(string.Join(", " , intSequence.Append(5));

//output:
10, 20, 30, 40, 5
```

```csharp
int[] numbersSequence = { 10, 20, 30, 40, 50 };
string[] wordsSequence = { "Ten", "Twenty", "Thirty", "Fourty" };
var resultSequence = numbersSequence.Zip(wordsSequence, (first, second) => first + " - " + second);

//output:
10 - Ten
```

```csharp
 class Program
    {
        public static void Main()
        {
            List<Product> listProducts = new List<Product>
            {
                new Product { ID= 1001, Name = "Mobile", Price = 800 },
                new Product { ID= 1002, Name = "Laptop", Price = 900 },
                new Product { ID= 1003, Name = "Desktop", Price = 800 }
            };
            Dictionary<int, Product> productsDictionary = listProducts.ToDictionary(x => x.ID);
            foreach (KeyValuePair<int, Product> kvp in productsDictionary)
            {
                Console.WriteLine(kvp.Key + " Name : " + kvp.Value.Name + ", Price: " + kvp.Value.Price);
            }
            Console.ReadKey();
        }
    }
}
```

# **Differences LINQ JOIN Vs GROUP JOIN Methods**

The **JOIN** operation is similar to the **INNER JOIN** in SQL, meaning it only includes elements that have a match in **both collections.**

**GROUP JOIN:** It is more akin to a left **outer join in SQL**, where **all elements** from the **first sequence are included**, and the **matching elements** from the **second sequence** are grouped together as a collection within each result.
