### Key Differences

| Aspect             | `Exception`                                   | `Error`                                                   |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Definition**     | An object representing a runtime anomaly.     | A critical problem or flaw in the program or environment. |
| **Type**           | Object (`System.Exception` or derived class). | Condition that often leads to an exception.               |
| **Handling**       | Can be caught and handled using `try-catch`.  | Often not handled; requires debugging or fixing.          |
| **Examples**       | `NullReferenceException`, `IOException`.      | Stack overflow, out-of-memory error.                      |
| **Recoverability** | Program can often recover and continue.       | Program usually cannot recover without intervention.      |
| **Usage**          | Used to manage code-level issues gracefully.  | Indicates fundamental flaws that need fixing.             |

### Summary

- **Exceptions** are manageable and expected events that can be handled at runtime, allowing your application to continue or fail gracefully.
- **Errors** are more severe issues that often indicate fundamental problems in the code or environment and usually require changes to the codebase or environment to fix.
