A **file handle** (or file descriptor) is a way the operating system keeps **track** of which 
files are **open**, how they can be **used** (for reading, writing, or both), and their **current status**. 
It works like an **ID** or a **reference** for the file, *helping the system know* which file you're **working** 
with at any moment.
