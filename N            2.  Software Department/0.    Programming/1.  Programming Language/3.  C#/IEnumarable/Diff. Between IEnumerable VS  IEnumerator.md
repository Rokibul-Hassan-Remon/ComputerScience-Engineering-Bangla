`IEnumerable` and `IEnumerator` are both interfaces in C# that play crucial roles in collection iteration, but they serve different purposes. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of their differences:

### 1. Purpose

- **IEnumerable**:
    
    - Represents a collection that can be enumerated (iterated over).
    - Provides a method to obtain an enumerator (`GetEnumerator()`).
    - It is the interface that allows for the use of `foreach` loops on a collection.
- **IEnumerator**:
    
    - Represents an enumerator that provides the ability to iterate through a collection.
    - Provides methods to move through the collection (`MoveNext()`), reset the enumerator (`Reset()`), and access the current element (`Current`).
    - It is the mechanism that actually performs the iteration.

### 2. Key Methods and Properties

- **IEnumerable**:
    
    - Contains a single method
```c#
IEnumerator GetEnumerator();
```
