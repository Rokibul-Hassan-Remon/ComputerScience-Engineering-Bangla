**Dear HR Sakib Hasan,**

In response to the **Software Developer (Entry Level)** position at **Smart Field Services**, I am writing to express my interest in this role. I believe I have the skills and qualifications to make a significant contribution to your organization.

I have completed a B.Sc. in Computer Science and Engineering from Mawlana Bhashani Science and Technology University, where I achieved a CGPA of 3.42. During my studies, I acquired proficiency in programming languages such as C, C++, Python, JavaScript, and C#. I have taken several relevant courses, including Database Management Systems, Visual Programming, Data Structures, Multimedia and Web Engineering, and Object-Oriented Programming.

I have completed two projects:

- **"Library Management System"**: Developed using the MVC design pattern in ASP.NET Core with C#. This system supports data insertion, deletion, and detailed viewing, along with file handling for document management.
- **“CRUD Application Using Clean Architecture with Repository Pattern”**: Built a comprehensive CRUD application in ASP.NET Core using a layered architecture, including web, model, repository, and service projects. I implemented interfaces in the service layer to promote abstraction and flexibility.

I have a strong understanding of the MVC architecture and have implemented it in multiple projects using ASP.NET Core.

I would greatly appreciate your review of my enclosed resume. I believe that I can be a valuable addition to your team. At your convenience, I am available for an interview or further discussion. I look forward to hearing from you. You can reach me by phone at **01788639400** or via email at **[cse19015@gmail.com](mailto:cse19015@gmail.com)**.
