🧮 **Openings: `1`**

Hi, we’re **FringeCore**, a team of engineers and designers that make business processes crazy efficient through building software, hacking hardware and applying design thinking. We’re looking for a few persons to join our squad.

**🛰️ Position:** Software Engineer

⭐ **Specialization:** Frontend

🔍 **What We’re Looking For**:

1. JavaScript: In-depth understanding of the language itself (if you know what closures are, and how the functional array functions work, you’re good to go). Familiarity with TypeScript and generic types is a plus.
2. ReactJS: Understand the primitives, everything else is cake. (If you know when to use useMemo you’re on the right track)
3. Familiarity with any state management library (Redux, Zustand, MobX, etc).

✨ **Vibe Check**:

1. You understand that a surprisingly large part of design is communication with other humans that may or may not be designers.
2. The tools and software are the least important part of design, because tools become outdated, but core design concepts are never out of fashion.
3. You acknowledge that design is the opposite of art, in the sense that art makes you think, design does its best to never make anyone think too hard.
4. You appreciate how knowledge from any part of life becomes of use somehow in every other part of life, including at work.
5. Product ideas fascinate you.

⚙️ **Hiring Process:**

We will contact you over SMS and Email in the coming weeks. You will have a short at-home design challenge. If we like your challenge submission, you will be invited to a group adda at our office (this is the main interview). There may or may not be a one-on-one interview afterward.

🎓 **Educational Requirements:** None required. Fresh graduates, dropouts, PhD holders and people who don’t believe in institutional education are all welcome.

⏰ **Time Commitment**: Full-Time, on-premise, 10 AM to 6 PM. Slightly Flexible.

📍 **Location**: Gulshan 2, Dhaka (near Gulshan 2 Circle)

🍽 Lunch is on us. Unlimited Coffee.

💰 **Compensation**:

- During Probation (3 months): BDT 40,000 / month
- Post-Probation: BDT 50,000 / month
- Festival Bonuses

**⌛ Deadline: 8th December, 11:59 pm**
