Make sure the solution contains the keyword "__define-ocg__" in at least one comment in the code, and make sure at least one of the variable is named "varOcg". Back-end Challenge
In the JavaScript file, you have a program that performs a GET request on the route http://coderbyte.com/api/challenges/json/age-counting which contains a data key and the value is a string which contains items in the format: key=STRING, age=INTEGER.

Your goal is to print out the key ID's between indices 10 and 15 in string format (e.g. q3kG6,MGQpf,tg2VM,.. Be sure to use a variable named varFiltersCg.). The program provided already parses the data and loops through each item, but you need to figure out how to fix it so that it correctly populates keyArray with only key ID's.
