# Frontend / App Challenges

- Pick any one, or multiple, but definitely explore all of them and do which ever you fancy.
- Do note, the harder ones allow you to really display your creativity and may have less competition, where as the easier ones may have more competition and much smaller scope to display your skills and creativity.
- Once again, if you want you can submit multiple solutions to multiple challenges.
- If you’re good at React do `Block Graph` or `Recursive Partitioner` to best display your skills. Even partial solutions are a very good display of your skills.
- If you’re good at math, pick `Color Picker Pentagon`
