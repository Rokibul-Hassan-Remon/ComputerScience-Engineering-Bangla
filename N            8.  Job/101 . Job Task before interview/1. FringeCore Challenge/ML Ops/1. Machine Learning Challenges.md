# Machine Learning Challenges

- Pick any one, or multiple, but definitely explore all of them and do which ever you fancy.
- Do note, the harder ones allow you to really display your creativity and may have less competition, where as the easier ones may have more competition and much smaller scope to display your skills and creativity.
- Once again, if you want you can submit multiple solutions to multiple challenges.
- If you're skilled in image processing, try `capture-the-scene`
- If you're into NLP, tackle `meme-search`
- For computer vision and object detection, take on `service-time` and `waiter-calling`
