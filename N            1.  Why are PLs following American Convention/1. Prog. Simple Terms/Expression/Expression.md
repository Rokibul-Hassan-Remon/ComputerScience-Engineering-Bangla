In programming, an **expression** is a combination of variables, operators, values (constants or literals), and functions that can be evaluated to produce a single value. An expression typically forms a part of a larger statement and is evaluated based on the rules of the programming language in which it's written.

#### Example:
#### Mathematical Expression:
```csharp


int result = 5 + 3 * 2; // Expression: 5 + 3 * 2, result is 11

```


####  Boolean Expression:
```csharp
bool isEven = (number % 2 == 0); // Expression: number % 2 == 0

```

#### Function Call as an Expression:

```csharp
int max = Math.Max(5, 10); // Expression: Math.Max(5, 10), result is 10

```
